# Coursera_Capstone

This is my Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 
The first assignment was related to segmenting and clustering the neighborhoods of Toronto.
My final Project will be related to the City of New York, where an Investor wants to open a Restaurant in a borough which is the best fit to his criteria.
